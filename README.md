A comprehensive implementation of modern netcode techniques for real-time multiplayer games, written in Rust. This project demonstrates client-side prediction, server reconciliation, and lag compensation in a 2D physics-based multiplayer environment.

## Introduction

This project implements advanced networking techniques commonly used in competitive multiplayer games to provide responsive gameplay despite network latency and packet loss. The implementation follows industry best practices and includes comprehensive testing for all netcode components.

The game features a simple 2D platformer where multiple players can move around, jump, and collide with each other. While the gameplay is minimal, the networking implementation is production-quality and demonstrates sophisticated techniques for maintaining consistent game state across distributed clients.

**üéÆ Try it now!** A live demo server is hosted at `game.conrados.dev:8080` for immediate multiplayer testing without local setup.

## Using the Solution

### Running the Server

The game server manages authoritative game state and handles client connections:

```bash
# Basic server (localhost:8080, 60Hz, max 16 clients)
cargo run -p server

# Production server (all interfaces, custom settings)
cargo run -p server -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --tick-rate 60 --max-clients 50

# High-performance competitive server
cargo run -p server -- --tick-rate 128 --max-clients 8
```

**Server Configuration Options:**

-   `--host <IP>`: Bind address (127.0.0.1 for local, 0.0.0.0 for public)
-   `--port <PORT>`: UDP port to listen on
-   `--tick-rate <HZ>`: Simulation frequency (20-128 Hz recommended)
-   `--max-clients <N>`: Maximum concurrent players

### Running the Client

The game client connects to a server and provides the player interface:

```bash
# Quick start: Connect to live demo server
cargo run -p client -- --server game.conrados.dev:8080

# Connect to local server
cargo run -p client

# Connect to custom remote server
cargo run -p client -- --server 192.168.1.100:8080

# Test with artificial latency (50ms simulated ping)
cargo run -p client -- --fake-ping 50

# Connect to demo server with artificial latency for testing
cargo run -p client -- --server game.conrados.dev:8080 --fake-ping 100
```

**Client Configuration Options:**

-   `--server <ADDRESS>`: Server to connect to (format: host:port)
-   `--fake-ping <MS>`: Artificial latency for netcode testing

## API Documentation

### Network Protocol

The game uses a custom UDP-based protocol with the following packet types:

```rust
// Client -> Server
Connect { client_version: u32 }                    // Initial connection request
Input { sequence: u32, timestamp: u64, ... }       // Player input with sequencing
Disconnect                                          // Graceful disconnection

// Server -> Client
Connected { client_id: u32 }                       // Connection acknowledgment
GameState { tick: u32, players: Vec<Player>, ... } // Authoritative state update
Disconnected { reason: String }                    // Connection termination
```

### Server API

**Configuration:**

```rust
Server::new(addr: &str, tick_duration: Duration, max_clients: usize)
```

**Main Loop:**

```rust
server.run().await  // Starts the main server event loop
```

### Client API

**Configuration:**

```rust
Client::new(server_addr: &str, fake_ping_ms: u64)
```

**Main Loop:**

```rust
client.run().await  // Starts the main client game loop
```

```bash
cargo doc --open --no-deps
```
