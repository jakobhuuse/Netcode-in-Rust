/// Benchmarks collision detection performance for real-time gameplay requirements
///
/// This test measures the computational efficiency of the axis-aligned bounding box
/// (AABB) collision detection algorithm used throughout the game. Since collision
/// detection is called frequently during physics updates, it must be extremely fast
/// to maintain target frame rates.
///
/// ## Test Methodology
///
/// Creates two overlapping players and repeatedly calls `check_collision()` to
/// measure the average time per collision check. The test uses a high iteration
/// count to get statistically significant timing measurements.
///
/// ## Performance Targets
///
/// - **Target**: Sub-microsecond collision detection (< 1000 ns per check)
/// - **Acceptable**: Under 100ms total for 100,000 iterations
/// - **Reasoning**: With 60 FPS and multiple players, thousands of collision
///   checks may be needed per frame
///
/// ## Real-World Context
///
/// In actual gameplay scenarios:
/// - Each player checks collision against every other player each frame
/// - With N players, this requires N*(N-1)/2 collision checks per frame
/// - At 60 FPS with 8 players, this means ~1,680 collision checks per second
///
/// ## Benchmark Results Interpretation
///
/// The test outputs timing results in nanoseconds per iteration to help identify
/// performance regressions. Significant increases in timing may indicate:
/// - Algorithmic changes that increased computational complexity
/// - Compiler optimization regressions
/// - Platform-specific performance issues

/// Benchmarks collision resolution performance under realistic game conditions
///
/// This test measures the computational cost of resolving collisions between players,
/// including spatial separation and momentum exchange. Collision resolution is more
/// expensive than detection since it involves trigonometric calculations and state
/// modifications, but it should still complete quickly enough for real-time gameplay.
///
/// ## Test Methodology
///
/// For each iteration, creates two fresh colliding players with opposing velocities
/// and calls `resolve_collision()` to separate them and exchange momentum. This
/// simulates the common scenario of players running into each other during gameplay.
///
/// ## Performance Targets
///
/// - **Target**: Under 100 microseconds per collision resolution
/// - **Acceptable**: Under 1 second total for 10,000 iterations  
/// - **Reasoning**: Collision resolution happens less frequently than detection,
///   but must still be fast enough to handle multiple simultaneous collisions
///
/// ## Computational Complexity
///
/// The collision resolution algorithm involves:
/// - Center point calculations (2 divisions)
/// - Distance calculation (1 square root)
/// - Direction normalization (1 more division)
/// - Position and velocity updates (8 floating-point operations)
/// - Boundary clamping (4 min/max operations)
///
/// ## Real-World Scenarios
///
/// Typical collision resolution frequencies:
/// - **Rare**: 0-2 collisions per frame under normal gameplay
/// - **Common**: 2-5 collisions per frame in crowded areas
/// - **Stress**: 10+ collisions per frame in worst-case scenarios
///
/// The benchmark helps ensure the game remains responsive even during
/// intense collision scenarios like players clustering around objectives.

/// Benchmarks complete physics simulation performance with multiple players
///
/// This test evaluates the performance of running a complete physics simulation
/// step for a large number of players simultaneously. It measures the computational
/// cost of updating positions, applying gravity, and handling ground collisions
/// for an entire game world in a single frame.
///
/// ## Test Methodology
///
/// Creates 100 players distributed across the game world and runs 1000 physics
/// update iterations. Each iteration applies gravity, updates positions based on
/// velocity, and handles ground collision detection and response. This simulates
/// the server's physics update loop under high player load conditions.
///
/// ## Performance Targets
///
/// - **Target**: Complete 100-player physics update in under 5ms
/// - **Frame Budget**: Must fit within 16.67ms budget for 60 FPS gameplay
/// - **Scalability**: Linear performance scaling with player count
///
/// ## Physics Operations per Frame
///
/// For each player, the simulation performs:
/// - Gravity application (1 multiplication, 1 addition)
/// - Position updates (2 multiplications, 2 additions)  
/// - Ground collision check (1 comparison)
/// - Ground collision response (conditional position/velocity reset)
///
/// ## Real-World Performance Implications
///
/// This benchmark helps validate:
/// - **Server Capacity**: Maximum players per server instance
/// - **Frame Rate Stability**: Consistent 60 FPS under load
/// - **Resource Planning**: CPU requirements for hosting
///
/// ## Scaling Considerations
///
/// With N players, physics complexity scales as:
/// - Position updates: O(N) - linear scaling
/// - Collision detection: O(NÂ²) - quadratic scaling
/// - This test focuses on the O(N) component of physics simulation

/// Benchmarks network packet serialization and deserialization performance
///
/// This test measures the computational cost of converting game state data to/from
/// binary format for network transmission. Since game state packets are sent frequently
/// to all connected clients, serialization performance directly impacts server throughput
/// and network bandwidth efficiency.
///
/// ## Test Methodology
///
/// Creates a large GameState packet containing 50 players and comprehensive input
/// tracking data, then repeatedly serializes and deserializes it using the `bincode`
/// crate. This represents a worst-case scenario with maximum data payload size.
///
/// ## Performance Targets
///
/// - **Target**: Under 200 microseconds per serialization round-trip
/// - **Acceptable**: Under 2 seconds total for 10,000 iterations
/// - **Network Impact**: Fast serialization enables higher broadcast frequencies
///
/// ## Data Complexity Analysis
///
/// The test packet contains:
/// - **50 Players**: Each with position, velocity, and state data
/// - **Input Tracking**: Last processed input sequence per client
/// - **Metadata**: Tick numbers, timestamps, and protocol information
/// - **Total Size**: Approximately 2-4KB of serialized data
///
/// ## Real-World Network Scenarios
///
/// Serialization performance affects:
/// - **Broadcast Frequency**: How often server can send state updates
/// - **Server Capacity**: Maximum concurrent clients with acceptable performance
/// - **Bandwidth Efficiency**: CPU cost vs. compression trade-offs
///
/// ## Protocol Efficiency
///
/// The `bincode` crate provides:
/// - **Compact Encoding**: Binary format minimizes packet size
/// - **Zero-Copy**: Efficient deserialization where possible
/// - **Cross-Platform**: Consistent encoding across different architectures
///
/// This benchmark validates that the chosen serialization approach can meet
/// the high-frequency demands of real-time multiplayer networking.

/// at maximum rates or when processing input backlogs after network interruptions.
///
/// ## Test Methodology
///
/// Generates 1000 input events with varied timing patterns and validates that the
/// system can sort them by timestamp efficiently. This represents approximately
/// 16 seconds of gameplay at 60 FPS, compressed into a single processing burst.
///
/// ## Performance Targets
///
/// - **Target**: Process 1000 inputs in under 100ms
/// - **Real-Time Requirement**: Must not block main game loop
/// - **Scalability**: Handle input bursts during network recovery
///
/// ## Input Processing Scenarios
///
/// The test simulates various challenging input patterns:
/// - **Burst Processing**: Large number of inputs arriving simultaneously
/// - **Out-of-Order Delivery**: UDP packets arriving in wrong sequence
/// - **Temporal Sorting**: Maintaining chronological input order
/// - **Duplicate Detection**: Handling retransmitted inputs
///
/// ## Real-World Applications
///
/// This performance characteristic is crucial for:
/// - **Network Recovery**: Processing queued inputs after reconnection
/// - **Anti-Lag Systems**: Handling rapid input during lag compensation
/// - **Server Processing**: Managing multiple client input streams
///
/// ## Algorithmic Complexity
///
/// Input processing involves:
/// - **Sorting**: O(N log N) complexity for timestamp ordering
/// - **Validation**: O(N) complexity for duplicate detection
/// - **Application**: O(N) complexity for applying inputs to game state
///
/// The benchmark ensures these operations complete within acceptable time bounds
/// even when processing large input backlogs, maintaining responsive gameplay
/// during network instability or high-frequency input scenarios.
