//! # Integration Test Suite
//!
//! This module contains comprehensive integration tests that validate the complete
//! networked multiplayer game system behavior. Unlike unit tests that focus on
//! individual components, these tests verify that different modules work correctly
//! together and that the overall system meets its functional requirements.
//!
//! ## Test Philosophy
//!
//! ### End-to-End Validation
//! Integration tests simulate real-world scenarios where multiple game components
//! interact simultaneously. This catches bugs that only manifest when systems
//! work together, such as timing issues, state synchronization problems, and
//! protocol compliance failures.
//!
//! ### Realistic Scenarios
//! Tests use authentic data patterns and timing that reflect actual gameplay
//! conditions. This includes realistic packet sizes, typical input frequencies,
//! and representative player movement patterns.
//!
//! ### Network Protocol Validation
//! Comprehensive testing of the complete client-server communication protocol
//! ensures that all packet types can be transmitted, received, and processed
//! correctly under various network conditions.
//!
//! ## Test Categories
//!
//! ### Protocol Compliance Tests
//! Validate that the network protocol implementation correctly handles:
//! - **Packet Serialization**: All data structures survive encoding/decoding
//! - **Protocol Completeness**: Every packet type can be processed
//! - **Data Integrity**: Field values remain consistent across transmission
//! - **Version Compatibility**: Protocol changes maintain backward compatibility
//!
//! ### Game Logic Integration Tests
//! Verify that game mechanics work correctly across distributed components:
//! - **State Synchronization**: Client and server maintain consistent world state
//! - **Input Processing**: Player actions are applied correctly and consistently
//! - **Collision System**: Physics work identically on client and server
//! - **Boundary Conditions**: Edge cases are handled gracefully
//!
//! ### Network Communication Tests
//! Test real network operations to ensure robust communication:
//! - **UDP Socket Management**: Proper binding, sending, and receiving
//! - **Connection Lifecycle**: Establishment, maintenance, and termination
//! - **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network failures
//! - **Performance Under Load**: Behavior with high packet volumes
//!
//! ### Temporal Behavior Tests
//! Validate time-dependent aspects of the networked game:
//! - **Input Timing**: Proper handling of timestamped input events
//! - **Sequence Ordering**: Correct processing order despite UDP reordering
//! - **Lag Compensation**: Accurate temporal correlation across network delays
//! - **Synchronization**: Consistent frame timing between client and server
//!
//! ## Quality Assurance Strategy
//!
//! ### Regression Prevention
//! Integration tests provide comprehensive coverage to catch breaking changes:
//! - **API Changes**: Interface modifications that break compatibility
//! - **Protocol Changes**: Network format modifications that cause failures
//! - **Behavior Changes**: Logic modifications that alter game mechanics
//! - **Performance Regressions**: Changes that significantly impact performance
//!
//! ### Cross-Platform Validation
//! Tests run on multiple platforms to ensure consistent behavior:
//! - **Endianness**: Network protocol works across different byte orders
//! - **Floating Point**: Physics calculations produce identical results
//! - **Threading**: Concurrent operations behave consistently
//! - **Network Stack**: Socket operations work across different OS implementations
//!
//! ### Real-World Conditions
//! Tests simulate challenging network and system conditions:
//! - **Packet Loss**: UDP packets may be dropped during transmission
//! - **Reordering**: Packets may arrive out of chronological order
//! - **Latency**: Variable delays between client and server
//! - **Resource Constraints**: Limited bandwidth and processing capacity
//!
//! ## Test Execution and Automation
//!
//! ### Continuous Integration
//! Integration tests run automatically on every code change:
//! ```bash
//! cargo test --test integration_tests    # Run all integration tests
//! cargo test test_udp_socket             # Run specific test category
//! cargo test --release                   # Test with optimizations enabled
//! ```
//!
//! ### Local Development
//! Developers can run specific test suites during development:
//! - **Quick Validation**: Fast tests for rapid iteration
//! - **Comprehensive Testing**: Full suite before commit
//! - **Specific Scenarios**: Targeted tests for specific features
//!
//! ### Debugging and Diagnostics
//! Integration tests include comprehensive logging and diagnostics:
//! - **Network Packet Tracing**: Detailed logs of all network activity
//! - **State Snapshots**: Game state at key points during test execution
//! - **Timing Analysis**: Performance measurements for optimization
//! - **Error Context**: Rich error information for failure diagnosis

/// Tests complete packet serialization round-trip for network protocol validation
///
/// This test validates that all packet types in the network protocol can be
/// successfully serialized to binary format and then deserialized back to their
/// original form without data loss. This is critical for ensuring network
/// communication works correctly between client and server.
///
/// ## Test Coverage
///
/// The test validates multiple packet types to ensure comprehensive protocol coverage:
/// - **Connect Packet**: Initial client handshake with version information
/// - **Input Packet**: Player input with sequence, timestamp, and control flags
/// - **Future Extension**: Framework supports adding more packet types
///
/// ## Validation Strategy
///
/// For each packet type, the test:
/// 1. Creates a packet with specific test data
/// 2. Serializes it using `bincode::serialize()`
/// 3. Deserializes the binary data using `bincode::deserialize()`
/// 4. Verifies all fields match the original values exactly
///
/// ## Network Protocol Requirements
///
/// This test ensures:
/// - **Data Integrity**: No corruption during serialization/deserialization
/// - **Type Safety**: Correct packet type is preserved through the process
/// - **Field Accuracy**: All field values are preserved exactly
/// - **Format Stability**: Binary format remains consistent across versions
///
/// ## Real-World Implications
///
/// Successful round-trip serialization ensures:
/// - **Client-Server Communication**: Packets transmit correctly over UDP
/// - **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Same binary format across different architectures
/// - **Version Compatibility**: Protocol changes don't break existing clients
/// - **Performance**: Efficient encoding/decoding for real-time requirements
///
/// ## Error Detection
///
/// The test will fail if:
/// - Serialization produces different binary formats
/// - Deserialization returns different values
/// - Packet type information is lost or corrupted
/// - Any field values are modified during the process

/// Tests real UDP socket communication for network layer validation
///
/// This test validates that the game's network communication works correctly using
/// actual UDP sockets rather than mocked network interfaces. It simulates the basic
/// client-server packet exchange pattern that forms the foundation of the multiplayer
/// network protocol.
///
/// ## Test Architecture
///
/// The test creates a realistic client-server communication scenario:
/// - **Server Socket**: Binds to an available port and listens for incoming packets
/// - **Client Socket**: Connects and sends packets to the server

///
/// ### Socket Management
/// - **Binding**: Server successfully binds to available ports
/// - **Connection**: Client can establish communication with server
/// - **Address Resolution**: Proper handling of network addresses and ports
/// - **Resource Cleanup**: Sockets are properly managed and released
///
/// ### Packet Transmission
/// - **Send Operations**: Packets are successfully transmitted via UDP
/// - **Receive Operations**: Packets are correctly received and processed
/// - **Binary Integrity**: Packet data survives network transmission unchanged
/// - **Error Handling**: Network errors are properly detected and handled
///
/// ## Real-World Network Conditions
///
/// While this test runs on localhost for reliability, it validates:
/// - **Protocol Compliance**: UDP packet format and transmission patterns
/// - **Timing Behavior**: Realistic send/receive timing characteristics
/// - **Buffer Management**: Proper handling of network buffer sizes
/// - **Timeout Handling**: Appropriate timeouts for network operations
///
/// ## Integration Testing Scope
///
/// This test bridges the gap between unit tests and real deployment by:
/// - **System Integration**: Testing actual system socket APIs
/// - **Threading Model**: Validating concurrent network operations
/// - **Error Scenarios**: Testing realistic failure modes
/// - **Performance Baseline**: Establishing basic network performance expectations
///
/// ## Failure Modes
///
/// The test may fail due to:
/// - **Port Conflicts**: Other services using required network ports
/// - **Network Stack Issues**: OS-level networking problems
/// - **Timing Problems**: Race conditions in concurrent operations
/// - **Resource Exhaustion**: Insufficient system resources for socket operations

///
/// This test validates that the collision system works correctly when detection
/// and resolution components operate together, ensuring that player interactions

/// Tests player boundary constraint enforcement for world containment
///
/// This test validates that the boundary enforcement system correctly prevents
/// players from moving outside the defined game world while maintaining proper
/// physics behavior at world edges. It ensures that world boundaries provide
/// consistent and predictable containment behavior.
///
/// ## Boundary Enforcement Scenarios
///
/// ### Horizontal Boundaries
/// - **Left Edge**: Players cannot move left of X coordinate 0
/// - **Right Edge**: Players cannot move right of (WORLD_WIDTH - PLAYER_SIZE)
/// - **Clamping Behavior**: Out-of-bounds positions are corrected to valid coordinates
/// - **Velocity Preservation**: Boundary clamping doesn't affect player velocity inappropriately
///
/// ### Vertical Boundaries
/// - **Floor Collision**: Players cannot move below the defined floor level
/// - **Ground State**: Touching the floor correctly sets on_ground status
/// - **Velocity Zeroing**: Downward velocity is eliminated upon ground contact
/// - **Position Correction**: Player Y position is adjusted to rest on the floor
///
/// ## Physics Integration
///
/// ### Ground Mechanics
/// When players hit the floor boundary:
/// - **Position Adjustment**: Y coordinate is set to exactly (FLOOR_Y - PLAYER_SIZE)
/// - **Velocity Reset**: Vertical velocity becomes zero to prevent bouncing
/// - **State Update**: on_ground flag is set to true, enabling jumping
/// - **Physics Consistency**: Player remains stable on the ground surface
///
/// ### Boundary Clamping Algorithm
/// For horizontal boundaries:
/// - **Range Validation**: Position is checked against valid coordinate range
/// - **Immediate Correction**: Out-of-bounds positions are instantly corrected
/// - **Smooth Behavior**: Boundary enforcement doesn't cause jerky movement
/// - **Predictable Results**: Players always know exactly where boundaries are
///
/// ## Real-World Gameplay Implications
///
/// ### Player Experience
/// Proper boundary enforcement ensures:
/// - **World Consistency**: Players understand the limits of the game world
/// - **Predictable Movement**: Players can't accidentally leave the playable area
/// - **Fair Gameplay**: All players are subject to the same spatial constraints
/// - **No Glitches**: Players can't exploit boundary conditions to gain advantages
///
/// ### Technical Requirements
/// The boundary system must:
/// - **Handle Edge Cases**: Work correctly when players are exactly at boundaries
/// - **Maintain Performance**: Boundary checks don't impact frame rate
/// - **Support Physics**: Work seamlessly with collision detection and resolution
/// - **Enable Features**: Ground detection enables jumping and other mechanics
///
/// ## Test Coverage
///
/// The test validates multiple boundary scenarios:
/// 1. **Left Boundary**: Player position corrected when moving too far left
/// 2. **Right Boundary**: Player position corrected when moving too far right
/// 3. **Floor Boundary**: Player position, velocity, and ground state corrected when hitting floor
/// 4. **State Consistency**: All related player state variables are properly updated
///
/// ## Integration Validation
///
/// This test ensures boundary enforcement integrates correctly with:
/// - **Movement System**: Boundaries don't interfere with normal movement
/// - **Physics System**: Ground detection works with gravity and jumping
/// - **Collision System**: Boundaries don't conflict with player-player collisions
/// - **Network System**: Boundary enforcement is consistent across client and server

/// Utility function to get current system timestamp in milliseconds
///
/// This helper function provides a consistent way to generate timestamps for
/// input events and other time-sensitive operations during testing. It returns
/// the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).
///
/// ## Implementation Details
///
/// The function uses the standard library's `SystemTime` to get the current
/// time and converts it to milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Error handling
/// ensures that the function always returns a valid timestamp, even if system
/// time operations fail.
///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// If `SystemTime::now()` or duration calculation fails (extremely rare), the
/// function returns 0 as a fallback value. This ensures tests don't panic due
/// to time-related system errors while still providing meaningful timestamp
/// values for normal operation.
///
/// ## Usage in Tests
///
/// This function is used throughout the integration tests to:
/// - **Generate Input Timestamps**: Create realistic timestamp values for input events
/// - **Measure Time Differences**: Validate that successive calls return increasing values
/// - **Simulate Real Conditions**: Use actual system time rather than mock values
/// - **Ensure Consistency**: Provide consistent timestamp format across all tests
///
/// ## Precision and Range
///
/// - **Resolution**: Millisecond precision is sufficient for gameplay timing requirements
/// - **Range**: u64 provides sufficient range for many centuries of operation
/// - **Compatibility**: Millisecond timestamps are compatible with web and network standards
/// - **Performance**: Fast execution suitable for high-frequency calls during testing
